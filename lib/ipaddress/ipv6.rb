  #
  # =Description
  # 
  # Class IPAddress::IPv6 is used to handle IPv6 type addresses. 
  #
  # == IPv6 addresses
  #
  # IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, in contrast with IPv4 addresses
  # which are only 32 bits long. An IPv6 address is generally written as
  # eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16
  # bits or two octect. For example, the following is a valid IPv6
  # address:
  #
  #   2001:0db8:0000:0000:0008:0800:200c:417a
  #
  # Letters in an IPv6 address are usually written downcase, as per
  # RFC. You can create a new IPv6 object using uppercase letters, but
  # they will be converted.
  #
  # === Compression
  #
  # Since IPv6 addresses are very long to write, there are some
  # semplifications and compressions that you can use to shorten them.
  #
  # * Leading zeroes: all the leading zeroes within a group can be
  #   omitted: "0008" would become "8"
  #
  # * A string of consecutive zeroes can be replaced by the string
  #   "::". This can be only applied once.
  #
  # Using compression, the IPv6 address written above can be shorten into
  # the following, equivalent, address
  #
  #   2001:db8::8:800:200c:417a
  #
  # This short version is often used in human representation.
  #
  # === Network Mask
  #
  # As we used to do with IPv4 addresses, an IPv6 address can be written
  # using the prefix notation to specify the subnet mask:
  #
  #   2001:db8::8:800:200c:417a/64
  #
  # The /64 part means that the first 64 bits of the address are
  # representing the network portion, and the last 64 bits are the host
  # portion.
  #

    # Format string to pretty print IPv6 addresses
    #
    IN6FORMAT = ("%.4x:"*8).chop
    
    #
    # Creates a new IPv6 address object.
    #
    # An IPv6 address can be expressed in any of the following forms:
    # 
    # * "2001:0db8:0000:0000:0008:0800:200C:417A": IPv6 address with no compression
    # * "2001:db8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A": IPv6 address with leading zeros compression 
    # * "2001:db8::8:800:200C:417A": IPv6 address with full compression
    #
    # In all these 3 cases, a new IPv6 address object will be created, using the default
    # subnet mask /128
    #
    # You can also specify the subnet mask as with IPv4 addresses:
    #
    #   ip6 = IPAddress "2001:db8::8:800:200c:417a/64"

    # Spaceship operator to compare IPv6 objects
    #
    # Comparing IPv6 addresses is useful to ordinate
    # them into lists that match our intuitive 
    # perception of ordered IP addresses.
    # 
    # The first comparison criteria is the u128 value.
    # For example, 2001:db8:1::1 will be considered 
    # to be less than 2001:db8:2::1, because, in a ordered list,
    # we expect 2001:db8:1::1 to come before 2001:db8:2::1.
    #
    # The second criteria, in case two IPv6 objects 
    # have identical addresses, is the prefix. An higher
    # prefix will be considered greater than a lower
    # prefix. This is because we expect to see
    # 2001:db8:1::1/64 come before 2001:db8:1::1/65
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   ip1 = IPAddress "2001:db8:1::1/64"
    #   ip2 = IPAddress "2001:db8:2::1/64"
    #   ip3 = IPAddress "2001:db8:1::1/65"

    #   ip1 < ip2

  # It is usually identified as a IPv4 mapped IPv6 address, a particular
  # IPv6 address which aids the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. The
  # structure of the address is
  #
  #   ::ffff:w.y.x.z
  #
  # where w.x.y.z is a normal IPv4 address. For example, the following is
  # a mapped IPv6 address:
  #
  #   ::ffff:192.168.100.1
  #
  # IPAddress is very powerful in handling mapped IPv6 addresses, as the
  # IPv4 portion is stored internally as a normal IPv4 object. Let's have
  # a look at some examples. To create a new mapped address, just use the
  # class builder itself
  #
  #   ip6 = IPAddress::IPv6::Mapped.new "::ffff:172.16.10.1/128"
  #
  # or just use the wrapper method
  #
  #   ip6 = IPAddress "::ffff:172.16.10.1/128"
  #
  # Let's check it's really a mapped address:
  #
  #   ip6.mapped?
  #     #=> true
  #
  #   ip6.to_string
  #     #=> "::FFFF:172.16.10.1/128"
  #
  # Now with the +ipv4+ attribute, we can easily access the IPv4 portion
  # of the mapped IPv6 address:
  #
  #   ip6.ipv4.address
  #     #=> "172.16.10.1"
  #
  # Internally, the IPv4 address is stored as two 16 bits
  # groups. Therefore all the usual methods for an IPv6 address are
  # working perfectly fine:
  #
  #   ip6.to_hex
  #     #=> "00000000000000000000ffffac100a01"
  #
  #   ip6.address
  #     #=> "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ac10:0a01"
  #
  # A mapped IPv6 can also be created just by specify the address in the
  # following format:
  #
  #   ip6 = IPAddress "::172.16.10.1"
  #
  # That is, two colons and the IPv4 address. However, as by RFC, the ffff
  # group will be automatically added at the beginning
  #
  #   ip6.to_string
  #     => "::ffff:172.16.10.1/128"
