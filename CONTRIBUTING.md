## Versioning: Jeweler and Semantic Versioning

This repo uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) implemented by the [Jeweler Gem](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler).  Please do not update the version by editting files, instead, you may increment or modify the version using the Rake tasks added by Jeweler.

```
$ rake -T | grep version
rake version             # Displays the current version
rake version:bump:major  # Bump the major version by 1
rake version:bump:minor  # Bump the a minor version by 1
rake version:bump:patch  # Bump the patch version by 1
rake version:write       # Writes out an explicit version
```
